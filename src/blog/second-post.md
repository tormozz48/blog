Static site generators have become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. They offer a great balance between performance, security, and developer experience.

## What is a Static Site Generator?

A static site generator (SSG) is a tool that generates a full static HTML website based on raw data and a set of templates. Unlike dynamic websites that generate content on-the-fly, static sites are pre-built and served directly to users.

## Benefits of Static Sites

There are several advantages to using static site generators:

1. **Performance**: Static sites load faster because they don't require server-side processing or database queries.
2. **Security**: With no database or server-side code execution, static sites have a smaller attack surface.
3. **Scalability**: Static files are easy to cache and distribute through CDNs.
4. **Version Control**: Content can be managed through version control systems like Git.
5. **Developer Experience**: Modern SSGs offer great developer tools and workflows.

## Popular Static Site Generators

Some popular static site generators include:

- **Eleventy (11ty)**: A simpler static site generator
- **Next.js**: React-based framework with static export capabilities
- **Hugo**: Go-based generator known for its speed
- **Jekyll**: Ruby-based, popular for GitHub Pages
- **Gatsby**: React-based with GraphQL data layer

## Conclusion

Static site generators are a powerful tool for creating fast, secure websites. Whether you're building a personal blog, portfolio, or documentation site, there's likely a static site generator that fits your needs perfectly.
