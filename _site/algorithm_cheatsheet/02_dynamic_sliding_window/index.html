<h1>Dynamic Sliding Window Algorithm</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Dynamic Sliding Window algorithm is a technique used to process arrays or strings by maintaining a window of variable size that expands or contracts based on certain conditions. Unlike the fixed sliding window, the size of the window adjusts dynamically as we process the elements.</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finding the longest substring without repeating characters</li>
<li>Finding the minimum size subarray sum greater than a given value</li>
<li>Finding the longest substring with at most k distinct characters</li>
<li>Finding the smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to a target value</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code Example</h2>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">/**
 * Problem: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
 * 
 * @param s Input string
 * @returns Length of the longest substring without repeating characters
 */
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: string): number {
    if (s.length === 0) return 0;
    
    const charMap = new Map&lt;string, number&gt;();
    let maxLength = 0;
    let left = 0;
    
    // Right pointer expands the window
    for (let right = 0; right &lt; s.length; right++) {
        const currentChar = s[right];
        
        // If character is already in the window, move left pointer to position after the last occurrence
        if (charMap.has(currentChar) &amp;&amp; charMap.get(currentChar)! &gt;= left) {
            left = charMap.get(currentChar)! + 1;
        }
        
        // Update the last position of the character
        charMap.set(currentChar, right);
        
        // Update maximum length
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}

// Example usage
const str = &quot;abcabcbb&quot;;
console.log(`Length of longest substring without repeating characters: ${lengthOfLongestSubstring(str)}`);
// Output: Length of longest substring without repeating characters: 3 (substring &quot;abc&quot;)

<h2>LeetCode Example Problem</h2>
<p><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/">LeetCode 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters</a></p>
<h2>Complexity Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time Complexity</strong>: O(n) where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer and at most once by the left pointer).</li>
<li><strong>Space Complexity</strong>: O(min(m, n)) where m is the size of the character set and n is the length of the string. In the worst case, we might need to store all characters of the string in the hash map.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When to Use</h2>
<p>Use the dynamic sliding window technique when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to find a subarray or substring that satisfies certain conditions but the size is not fixed</li>
<li>The problem involves finding the longest/shortest subarray that meets specific criteria</li>
<li>The problem can be solved by expanding and contracting a window based on certain conditions</li>
<li>You want to avoid recalculating overlapping parts of subarrays</li>
</ul>
